## Tagged Resource Types
Resources successfully tagged with `decom:preserve=true`:
- ✅ All IAM roles (including service-linked roles)
- ✅ All IAM users and policies
- ✅ Control Tower CloudFormation stacks
- ✅ S3 buckets containing "modulairhr" or Control Tower logs
- ✅ Critical infrastructure components

## Failed Tagging Attempts
The 127 failed attempts are primarily due to:
- Service Control Policies restricting tagging in certain accounts
- Resources that don't support tagging (e.g., some service-linked roles)
- Resources in restricted regions

## Preservation Tags Applied
- **Primary Tag**: `decom:preserve=true`
- **Reason Tag**: `decom:reason=<specific reason>`

## Next Steps
With resources now properly tagged for preservation, we can safely proceed with:
1. ✅ Resources tagged - ready for cleanup phase
2. ⏳ Deploy account sweeper agents to remove untagged resources
3. ⏳ Deploy region sweeper agents for us-west-2 and us-east-1
4. ⏳ Run auditor to verify only preserved resources remain
