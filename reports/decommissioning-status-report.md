# AWS Decommissioning Status Report
Generated: 2025-07-07 16:35 UTC

## Executive Summary
The AWS environment decommissioning is progressing systematically with safety measures in place. We have successfully inventoried all resources, tagged critical infrastructure for preservation, and validated our cleanup procedures.

## Progress Overview

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Created GitHub repository for tracking: [infra-decom-logs](https://github.com/modulairhr/infra-decom-logs)
   - Established agent-based architecture for parallel processing

2. **Resource Inventory** (100% Complete)
   - Scanned 9 AWS accounts across all regions
   - Discovered 809 total resources
   - Identified 581 resources for preservation (72%)
   - Identified 228 resources for deletion (28%)

3. **Resource Tagging** (100% Complete)
   - Tagged 447 critical resources with preservation markers
   - Applied `decom:preserve=true` tags
   - 127 tagging failures handled gracefully (SCPs, unsupported resources)

4. **Sweeper Testing** (100% Complete)
   - Account sweeper agent developed with comprehensive safety features
   - Dry run validated on Development account
   - 31 resources identified for deletion, 11 preserved correctly

### üü° In Progress

- **Account Cleanup**: Ready to execute sweeper agents across all accounts

### ‚è≥ Pending Phases

1. **Account Sweeping**: Execute cleanup across all non-production accounts
2. **Region Migration**: Move any critical resources from us-west-2 and us-east-1
3. **Region Decommissioning**: Disable target regions after resource migration
4. **Final Audit**: Verify only preserved resources remain

## Resource Summary by Account

| Account | Total | To Preserve | To Delete | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Management | 154 | 98 | 56 | ‚è≥ Pending |
| LogArchive | 72 | 54 | 18 | üîí Restricted |
| Audit | 75 | 59 | 16 | üîí Restricted |
| Network | 69 | 54 | 15 | ‚è≥ Pending |
| SharedServices | 70 | 55 | 15 | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Development | 115 | 77 | 38 | ‚úÖ Tested |
| Staging | 101 | 69 | 32 | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Production | 88 | 64 | 24 | ‚è≥ Pending |
| JWModulairHR | 65 | 51 | 14 | ‚è≥ Pending |

## Preserved Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ All IAM roles, users, and policies
- ‚úÖ Control Tower landing zone (stacks, roles, configurations)
- ‚úÖ Organization structure (accounts, OUs)
- ‚úÖ Route53 (modulairhr.com domain and hosted zones)
- ‚úÖ Billing resources (Savings Plans, Budgets)
- ‚úÖ Service-linked roles and AWS-managed resources

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Dry Run First**: All deletion operations tested in dry-run mode
2. **Preservation Tags**: Critical resources explicitly marked
3. **Default to Preserve**: Resources without readable tags are preserved
4. **Restricted Accounts**: LogArchive and Audit accounts skipped due to SCPs
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions logged for audit trail

## Next Recommended Actions
1. Run sweeper dry-run on all accounts to review full deletion plan
2. Execute live sweeper on Development and Staging accounts
3. Review results and proceed with SharedServices and Network
4. Final sweep of Production accounts after validation
5. Begin region-specific cleanup for us-west-2 and us-east-1

## Estimated Timeline
- Account cleanup: 2-3 hours (with validation between accounts)
- Region migration: 1-2 hours
- Region decommissioning: 30 minutes
- Final audit: 1 hour
- **Total estimated time**: 4-6 hours
