## Preserved Resource Categories
The following resource types are marked for preservation:

- ✅ Control Tower landing zone resources
- ✅ Organization accounts and OUs
- ✅ Route53 hosted zones for modulairhr.com
- ✅ AWS Budgets and Savings Plans

## Key Findings
1. **Highest deletion targets**: Development (38), Staging (32), and Management (56) accounts have the most resources to delete
2. **Service Control Policies**: Some accounts (LogArchive, Audit) have SCPs that restrict certain operations, which is expected
3. **Regional distribution**: Resources are spread across multiple regions, with concentrations in us-east-1 and us-west-2

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Inventory complete - detailed results in `/agents/inventory/results/`
2. ⏳ Create tagging strategy for preservation
3. ⏳ Deploy account sweeper agents
4. ⏳ Deploy region sweeper agents
5. ⏳ Run auditor for compliance verification

## Regional Focus
Priority regions for decommissioning:
- **us-west-2**: Target for complete decommissioning
- **us-east-1**: Target for complete decommissioning (except global services)
